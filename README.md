Project Description: Based on the popular electronic game from Hasbro. This is a memory game where a sequence of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) will be played and the player must memorize and click the same color sequence in order to advance to the next level. For each level the player advances to, another color will be added to the sequence.

The player wins once they reach the 20th sequence; if not, the player must continue playing until the current color sequence is correct.

This memory game also includes the option to play in 'Strict Mode'. Playing the game in strict mode allows the player only one time to get the color sequence correct before it automatically resets then the game is officially over; they must restart the game in order to play again. 

Project revisions to be made: The Game mode buttons (Start, Reset, Strict Mode) styling needs to be updated for a better user experience. Timer-based scoring needs to be included so the user can track their scores.
