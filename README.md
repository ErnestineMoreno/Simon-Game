## Project Description: 
[Ernestine Moreno's Simon Memory Game](https://ernestinemoreno.github.io/Simon-Game/)

Based on the popular electronic game from Hasbro. This is a memory game where a sequence of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) will be played and the player must memorize and click the same color sequence in order to advance to the next level. For each level the player advances to, another color will be added to the sequence.

The player wins once they reach the 20th color sequence; if not, the player must continue playing the current sequence until it is correct.

This memory game also includes the option for players to choose 'Strict Mode'. Strict Mode allows the player to click the correct color sequence only once before it automatically resets and the game is officially over. The player must select 'Start' in order order to play again.

## Proposed project revisions to be made in the future: 
The game mode buttons (Start, Reset, Strict Mode) styling needs to be updated for a better user experience. Timer-based scoring needs to be included so the user can track their scores. The colored buttons need to remain non-clickable as the color sequence is active. Modal also needs to be included to explain 'Strict Mode' to users.
