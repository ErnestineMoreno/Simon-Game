Project Description: Based on the popular electronic game from Hasbro. This is a memory game where a sequence of four colors (red, green, blue, yellow) will be played and you must memorize and click the same color sequence in order to win the game. For each round the player advances to, another color lens will be added to the sequence.

The player wins once they reach the 20th color sequence; if not, the player must continue playing until the current color sequence is correct.

This memory game also includes the option to play in 'Strict Mode'. Playing the game in strict mode allows the player only one time to get the color sequence correct before it automatically resets then the game is officially over; they must restart the game in order to play again.
